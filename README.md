# Used Car Price Prediction

This repository contains Python code to predict the prices of used cars using linear regression. The model utilizes key attributes such as mileage, brand, age, and condition to estimate the price of a used car.

## Overview

This project aims to predict the prices of used cars based on their characteristics using linear regression. It provides insights into how different factors influence car prices in the used car market.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes information about various used cars, such as:
- Mileage
- Brand
- Age
- Condition
- Price (target variable)

The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

## Libraries Used

The project uses the following Python libraries:
- `numpy` and `pandas` for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- `scikit-learn` for implementing linear regression, preprocessing tools, and model evaluation.

## Usage

To use this repository:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/used-car-price-prediction.git
   cd used-car-price-prediction

Model
The linear regression model is trained on the dataset to establish relationships between car attributes and prices. It predicts the price of a used car based on input features such as mileage, brand, age, and condition.
